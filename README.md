“This ATM app is a full-stack Next.js system with secure cookie sessions, MongoDB persistence, and modular domain logic. I use both Mongoose and MongoClient where it makes sense, decoupled business logic in service files, and React Query for instant UI hydration. It’s secured by middleware, has optional rate limiting, and supports export and persistent logging of all transactions. With more time, I’d productionize it with iron-session, testing, and CI/CD pipelines.”
